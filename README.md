# Password-Policies

## Objective
Understand password strength and learn how to create secure passwords that protect against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

## Tools Used
- **Website used:** https://passwordmeter.com/
- **Purpose:** Test and evaluate the strength of multiple passwords.

## Password Testing Results

| Password | Length | Upper | Lower | Digits | Symbols | Score | Strength | Notes |

| `student` | 7 | No | Yes | No | No | 5 % | Very Weak | Dictionary word, all lowercase |
| `Student` | 7 | Yes | Yes | No | No | 21 % | Weak | Only one capital letter |
| `Student123` | 10 | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | 69 % | Fair | Adds digits but predictable |
| `Student@123` | 11 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 87 % | Good | Symbol improves strength |
| `Stu69nt_Cs2@2025*` | 18 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 100 % | Strong | Long, complex pattern |

## Analysis
- **student:** Very weak – common word, easy for dictionary attack.  
- **Student:** Weak – only capitalizes the first letter.  
- **Student123:** Fair – adds digits but uses a common number pattern.  
- **Student@123:** Good – adds symbol; still a predictable base word.  
- **Stu69nt_Cs2@2025\***: Strong – long, mixes cases, numbers, and symbols.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common word lists.  
  ➤ Defend by avoiding dictionary words and adding complexity.  
- **Brute-Force Attack:** Tries every character combination.  
  ➤ Defend by using long passwords (12 + characters) and mixed types.

## Best Practices for Password Policies
1. Use **12+ characters**.  
2. Mix atleast one **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols** use complexly.  
3. **Avoid** dictionary words or predictable sequences or regular words like your name or family member names any of your personal details as possible.  
4. Use **unique passwords** each one.
5. **Avoid** to use single password in multiple times or sites.
6. Store them with a **password manager**.  
7. Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.

## Use Strong Passwords (Examples)

2. Geds78&Kl2!bV2415**

## Conclusion
Long, complex, mixed-character passwords are far stronger than short, simple ones. This type of passwords we use must be high safty is possible. So everyone should follow the password policies.
